Reflect: Initializing a Repository
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
* Git creates a hidden folder <.git> with its own files in it.
  So this hidden folder contains the metadata about the repository.
* I guess it's to get git to prepare for keeping the history of the repository.

Reflect: Staging Area
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
* It is different in that it a conceptual stage between the repository and commits.
  it is some kind of cache stage for commits. one puts files in it before commiting.

Reflect: Commit Size
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
* I could use <git diff> to get the changes between the working directory and the staging area.
  or i could use use <git diff --staged> to see differences between my changes and the last commit, if i've added the changes to the staging area.
  This would help me see the changes and help decide if they are enough for a commit.
